## AI Studio Website Rebrand Plan

This document proposes page-by-page content updates to rebrand the site into AiStudio’s client-facing website. Focus: what AiStudio does, why it matters, and the value/outcomes for clients. Team bios remain as-is for now.

Notes
- Content draws from your synthesized marketing brief. Citations are for internal validation only; they won’t appear on the site copy.
- We’ll refine tone and finalize copy via review. This is Draft v0.

### Outcomes Snapshot (optional band)
- 74% struggle to scale AI value → We prioritize measurable outcomes.

## Page 2: About (`/about`)

### The Problem: “Pilot Purgatory”
- Many AI initiatives produce demos, not business outcomes.
- Challenges:
  - **Failure to scale value** (majority of firms)
  - **Runaway costs** from misplaced architecture bets
  - **Data security & governance** pressure (private/on‑prem moves)
  - **Siloed tools** that don’t learn from each other

### Our Answer: Outcome‑Driven Partnership
- **Outcome‑aligned engagement**: 33% of fees linked to KPI success.
- **Embedded execution**: We work shoulder‑to‑shoulder with your teams.
- **Transparency**: No black boxes; shared observability and controls.

### Why Now (optional global context)
- Convergence of infrastructure readiness, capital deployment, and market window — but execution wins timing. We bridge ambition and delivery.

### Geographic/Footprint (optional)
- Keep the global connections motif if desired; retitle as “Global Coverage, Local Execution.”

## Tone & Style Guidelines

- **Outcome‑first**: Emphasize measurable business results.
- **Clear, direct, technical‑savvy**: Avoid fluff; be precise about how value is created.
- **Trust & transparency**: No black‑box language; stress observability and governance.
- **Speed with safety**: Weeks to production, with controls and compliance by design.

## Open Questions (for next review)

1. Industry emphasis: Financial institutions primary—do we reference others (e.g., energy, telecom) or stay finance‑only?
2. Case studies/logos: Are we cleared to include anonymized outcomes or industry badges?
3. Pricing disclosure: Mention the “33% KPI‑linked” model publicly or reserve for conversations?
4. Deployment posture: Explicitly offer on‑prem/private cloud guarantees on the site?
5. Compliance posture: Any specific regions (e.g., UAE/MENA) and data residency commitments to state?
6. Keep global map motif on About—or replace with “From AI‑ready to AI‑native” infographic?
7. CTA focus: Should primary CTA be “Start Workshop” across all pages, or split between Workshop and Expert Call?

## Next Steps

- Review and select hero + subheadline variant for Home.
- Confirm whether to retain map section and partner/advisor strip.
- Approve copy for each page section; provide any compliance/legal constraints.
- Then I will implement copy changes and microcopy updates in the respective components, with no structural overhauls unless requested.
